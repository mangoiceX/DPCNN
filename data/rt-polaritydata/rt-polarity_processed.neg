in the era of the it feels painfully redundant and
the overall is and like orgy for pretentious arts majors
script is sketchy with notations on the margin of acting
no question that scores once or twice but telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head
if only merchant paid more attention the story
at the mark simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie to its inevitable tragic conclusion
too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be
simpler leaner treatment would have been preferable after all being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something
the characters are based on stock and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility

helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot but even he is overwhelmed by predictability
the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time
comes off more like flat unconvincing drama that never catches fire
cinematic

contains few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether in part because the consciously approach wears thin
nothing more than widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get kick out of goofy with cute accents performing slapstick and unfunny tricks
this is film for those who when they were in high school would choose the over reading classic
the movie is undone by methodology just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing to hardened
jumbled comedy that did not figure out coherent game plan at scripting shooting or stages

fascinating but choppy documentary
scarcely worth mention apart from reporting on the number of blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company
the banter of welcome to has cocky to it and as with most bull sessions eventually the content nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is
too stagey and long for its own good
apparently reassembled from the floor of any given daytime soap
the sinister inspiration that fuelled early work is confused in death to into something both ugly and mindless
despite performance rather listless amble down the middle of the road where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug
director instead opts for routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through
little more than television melodrama shot for the big screen
never comes together as coherent whole
an unintentionally surreal picture in which actors in bad bear suits enact sort of parody of behind the music episode
first for movie that tries to be smart dumb and second with all the shooting
even bother to rent this on video
there is something in full frontal guess about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them but like most movie riddles it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see
this is the kind of movie that gets quick release before real contenders arrive in september

mawkish that plays like some weird masterpiece sketch with neither point of view nor compelling reason for being
an average with no aspirations to be anything more
hero remains reactive cipher when opening the head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made
and just want to string the bastard up
the plot is plastered with one cliche after another most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults
less worrying about covering all the drama in life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this superior movie
film that suffers because of its many excesses
too bland and tasteful to be truly prurient
in any case would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since forget paris but even then recommend waiting for and just skipping straight to her scenes
depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human on the screen then laughs at how clever being
says know how to and if you see this film know too
may one day be fondly remembered as roman brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell story worth caring about
the only thing scary about is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as scary movie
stale and uninspired
dreary movie
the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank
instead of contriving climactic death for the why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil laser guns actually hit something for once
it just mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get hold on or be entertained by

kilted is an unsettling sight and indicative of his if you will character who rambles aimlessly through action pieces
contrived awkward and filled with unintended laughs the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster

the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pyrotechnics its punchy style promises
the only question is to determine how well the is manufactured to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering average at best afraid
this movie is so bad that almost worth seeing because so bad
crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing
this movie feel more like cry for attention than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment
overall pretty mediocre family film
love may have been in the air but certainly feeling any of it
in addition to the overcooked direction which has all the actors reaching for the back row the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry
the very definition of what critics have come to term an ambitious failure
as if spent an hour setting fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese
the movie ends with in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter which is better than most of the writing in the movie
worthy of the gong
while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart film falls short in building the drama of journey
found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays
the of the film although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit eventually becomes too heavy for the plot
the movie add anything fresh to the myth
as inept as remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west
comes across as relic from bygone era and its convolutions feel silly rather than plausible

is the mere suggestion albeit visually compelling one of fully story
the whole movie is simply lazy exercise in bad that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well
the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from lifetime of spiritual inquiry but ram fierce grace it with any particular insight
pompous and garbled
billy crystal and sleepwalk through vulgarities in sequel you can refuse
loud and boring watching it is like being trapped at bad rock concert

outside of desire to make some kind of film really unclear why this project was undertaken
was scared only at the prospect of next project see haunted house haunted ship next ghost blimp
fragile framework upon which to hang broad mildly characters that seem to have been conjured up only minutes prior to filming

completely creatively stillborn and executed in manner that not sure could be single iota worse soulless hunk of exploitative garbage
an uneven look into grim future that come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on stories
horrible

this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about pair of squabbling spouses is deeply unpleasant experience
better than the phantom menace but unless an absolute raving star wars junkie it much fun
philosophically intellectually and logistically mess
standard drama that were it not for participation would have likely wound up original
coupling disgracefully written dialogue with bodily movements that substitute for acting circuit is the awkwardly paced soap story
ending just very funny

this is no
its generic villains lack any intrigue other than their funny accents and the action scenes are poorly delivered
dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to the material
slasher will find things to like but overall the series has lost its edge
stiff and and clumsily directed
the story the movie tells is of addiction to the suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career
too many improbabilities and situations temper what been an impacting film
generic nonsense but not without style
with tiny little jokes and an original idea this ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool
